During investigation i found the following regarding the PRICE FILTERS:
	Lowest price filter applies in API call and UI
	Highest price filter applies only in UI
	
	Each time the LOWEST price is INCREASED or DECREASED a new API call is made with the respective price as filter
	Each time the HIGHEST price is DECREASED (without changing the lowest price) the same API call is made with only the LOWEST price as filter
	Each time the HIGHEST price is INCREASED (without changing the lowest price) NO new API call is made
		-> Not sure if this is a bug on intended behaviour
